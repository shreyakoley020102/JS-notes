Asynchronous code is executed after a task that runs in the "background finishes"
it is non-blocking
execution doesn't wait for an asynchronous task to finish its work

const p = document.querySelector('.p');
setTimeout(function(){
 p,textContent='My name is Shreya!';
}, 5000);
p.style.color='red';
