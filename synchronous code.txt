Most of the code that we write is synchronous 
they are executed line by line
Each line of code waits for previous line to finish
Long running operations block code execution

Example of synchronous code:-

const p = document.query('.p');
p.textContent='My name is Shreya!';
alert('Text Set!');
p.style.color='red';
