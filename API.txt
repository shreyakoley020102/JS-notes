API:
Application Programming Interface
Piece of software that can be used by another piece of software, in order to allow applications to talk to each other and exchange informations.

Example- DOm API, geolocation API, Own Class API

"Online" API: application running on server, that receives frequests for data and sends data back as response

we can build our own web APIs(require backend development, eg with node.js) or use 3rd party APIs. There is an API for everything

AJAX: asynchronous JS and XML 
(Now we don't use XML anymore)
these days most APIs use JSON data format
